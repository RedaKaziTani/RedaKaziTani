Ahlen there !🤠 I'm Reda and currently I'm all in game design in tabletop 🎲 and video games 🦹🏻‍♂️. On the side, I'm trying to fix my mathematics foundational knowledge 🔧. In my free time, I like to unwind by watching mostly series (Silo is one of my faves) and anime (HxH, Hajime No Ippo and Demon's Slayer stick to the mind as ones I've enjoyed)
